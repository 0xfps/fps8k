My name is Anthony, fps is my nickname and a name I use across all my social media handles. I am a 19 year old male (He/Him). <br/><br/>

I started my programming journey in August 2018, with web development, starting with the frontend HTML, CSS, then Javascript and backend PHP and MySQL, then finally, Bootstrap.

In 2022, I developed a voracious interest for learning and writing Smart Contracts, deployable on the Ethereum network, and so far I have learnt a lot. My repository <a target='_blank' href=''>`my-solidity`</a>
