My name is Anthony, fps is my nickname and a name I use across all my social media handles. I am a 19 year old male (He/Him). <br/><br/>

I started my programming journey in August 2018, with web development, starting with the frontend HTML, CSS, then Javascript and backend PHP and MySQL, then finally, Bootstrap.

In 2022, I developed a voracious interest for learning and writing Smart Contracts, deployable on the Ethereum network, and so far I have learnt a lot. My repository <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity'>`my-solidity`</a> has been a compilation of all the major and minor smart contracts I've written.

I am looking for people who know more than me in the Smart Contract ecosystem to collaborate and learn more.

You can ask me any thing via reaching me through email at <a href="mailto: anthony.nnaemeka.umeh@gmail.com">my email.</a>
