My name is Anthony, fps is my nickname and a name I use across all my social media handles. I am a 19 year old male (He/Him). <br/><br/>

I started my programming journey in August 2018, with web development, starting with the frontend HTML, CSS, then Javascript and backend PHP and MySQL, then finally, Bootstrap.

In 2022, I developed a voracious interest for learning and writing Smart Contracts <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/smart-contracts_3605288?term=smart%20contracts&page=1&position=5&page=1&position=5&related_id=3605288&origin=search"></a>, deployable on the Ethereum network, and so far I have learnt a lot.
